  text:
    -  Buxx is a Dubai based DJ with a keen ear to provide appropriate sets for any venue. With a clear passion for music, seamless mixing and thoughtful track selection Buxx will take great satisfaction in entertaining your audience. With a collection at his fingertips of almost 8000 tracks ranging across a wide variety of genres, there is something for everyone to enjoy in his dynamic sets. 

    -  After attending some of the world’s biggest parties and developing a deep interest in all forms of electronic music, Buxx went on to complete a professional DJ course with Granular DXB and a variety of online courses such as that of renowned House music label Toolroom. Buxx also further pursued his passion for music through various production courses with Point Blank Music School and private tuition / masterclasses with local and international recognised producers. Finally, after several years of hard work Buxx hopes to release his first 4 track E.P. in the Afro / Melodic house genres. 

    -  Buxx takes inspiration from a wide variety of Artists all with their own flavours and suitability for different types of events. Examples include Black Coffee, Hot Since 82, Eelke Kleijn, Dusky, Yotto, Adriatique and The Martinez Brothers. Although his music taste matured into electronic styles during adulthood, his knowledge of a wide range of Open Format genres is also evident in his sets with a history and ongoing interest in styles such as R&B, Hip Hop, 80s, Top 40 and Afrobeats to name just a few. Paying close attention to current trends of Music and recent hits means sets will be ever changing and relevant on any given week whilst not ignoring timeless music from the past. 

    -  Having gained experience playing at Candypants in the W Hotel (Palm Jumeirah), S Bar – SLS (Business Bay), Blue Seafood Asia (Waldorf DIFC), a successful residency at Masti (Previously La Mer), opening for Melodic Techno event Modulate at KYO (The Palm), various private / corporate events and playing to a crowd of 25000 people for Dubai Shopping Festival, Buxx is looking for further opportunities that may arise.
